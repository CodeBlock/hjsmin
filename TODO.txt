-------------------------

- Generate output using standard pretty print library, so it can be
  used with various backends


- Sort out semicolon insertion, as per http://oss.org.cn/ossdocs/web/js/js20/rationale/syntax.html
  Also: http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons

  Grammatical Semicolon Insertion

    Semicolons before a closing } and the end of the program are
    optional in both JavaScript 1.5 and 2.0. In addition, the
    JavaScript 2.0 parser allows semicolons to be omitted before the
    else of an if-else statement and before the while of a do-while
    statement.

  Line-Break Semicolon Insertion

    If the first through the nth tokens of a JavaScript program form
    are grammatically valid but the first through the n+1st tokens are
    not and there is a line break between the nth tokens and the n+1st
    tokens, then the parser tries to parse the program again after
    inserting a VirtualSemicolon token between the nth and the n+1st
    tokens.

- remove un-needed semicolons in pretty printer

- put in tests for all cases of elementList
